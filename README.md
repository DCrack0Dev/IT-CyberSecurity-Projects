# IT-Cybersecurity-Projects

This repository contains my personal IT and cybersecurity projects, A collection of IT and Cybersecurity projects including network setup, security hardening, vulnerability assessment, and Linux system security. Below is a list of the projects and their purpose:

## 1. Network Simulation (Packet Tracer)
- **Purpose**: Designed and simulated a small enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. Includes routers, switches, and PCs connected with correct IP configurations.

## 2. Network Security Hardening (Cisco IOS CLI)
- **Purpose**: Applied security hardening using Cisco IOS CLI. This includes configuring VLANs, securing router interfaces, and disabling unused ports.

## 3. Vulnerability Assessment (Kali Linux)
- **Purpose**: Conducted a vulnerability assessment on a sample network using Kali Linux tools such as nmap to identify open ports and vulnerabilities.

## 4. Linux System Hardening (Kali Linux WSL)
- **Purpose**: Configured and secured a Kali Linux system using WSL, implementing firewalls, users, and SSH configuration.

## 5. Log Monitoring & Analysis (Kali Linux WSL)
- **Purpose**: Monitored and analyzed system logs (e.g., auth.log) to detect unauthorized login attempts and suspicious activities.

## 6. CV and Documentation
